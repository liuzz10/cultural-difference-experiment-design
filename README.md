It contains several images and a script that I use to simulate dot moving and to record reaction time for research purposes. The publication is here <http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01508/full>

## Introduction
The experiment consisted of a training block and three formal blocks. The training block consisted of one 56-trial session to make the participant familiarize with the task. Each trial consisted of the presentation of one luminance decrement of either one of the focal dot clouds, preceded by an exogenous peripheral cue (50% chance). The 56-trial session included a random and continuous presentation of the following trials: 7 trials of red cue + red decrement, 7 trials of red cue + green decrement, 7 trials of green cue + red decrement, 7 trials of green cue + green decrement, 14 trials of no cue + red decrement, and 14 no cue + green decrement.  

Note: some of the notes (in green) might not show up because they were wrote in Chinese. 

## Installation
You need to install psychtoolbox (<http://psychtoolbox.org/>) before running the script.
